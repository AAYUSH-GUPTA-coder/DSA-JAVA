//An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper factors is greater than the number itself.
// For better understanding lets consider an example so that we can easily understand that exactly what is an abundant number.
//
//        Abundant number is also known as Excessive number.
//
//        Example :
//
//        Suppose an integer value is 24 , then its proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12, whose sum is 36.
//        Because 36 is more than 24, the number 24 is abundant. Its abundance is 36 âˆ’ 24 = 12.
