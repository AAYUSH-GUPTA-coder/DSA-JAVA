//Leap year is a year which is completely divisible by 4, but the year should not be a century year except when the year is divisible by 400. For better understanding letâ€™s consider an example.
//
//        Example : Suppose a year is 2016,
//
//        Then, check that it should be completely divisible by 4 and should not be a century year or can say that the year should not be completely divisible by 100 .
//
//        Yes, 2016 is completely divisible by 4 and not a century year, because it is not completely divisible by 400.
//
//        And now if the above condition do not gets true then check that the year is completely divisible by 400 or not.
//          1000
//        If either of the above conditions get true, then the year is a Leap Year, otherwise the year is not a Leap Year
